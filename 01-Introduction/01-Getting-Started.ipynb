    "# Getting Started with Julia\n",
    "## Introduction to Julia\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional scientific computing is heavily reliant on high-performance code, but with the rise of practical-but-slow languages, science heavily relies on specialized packages that often have a hidden set of \"machinery\" under the hood, to retain some of the execution speeds of high-performance languages, such as C and FORTRAN. The practicality of popular programming languages is a general result of their dynamic syntax, allowing for compact readable code, with minimal specification related to language requirements, such as static type specifications. Luckily, modern compiler technology can nearly completely compensate for the performance dips observed in dynamic languages like Python and Matlab. Julia is a compiled language that tries to fill this role. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, performance in Julia may be unintuitive in the beginning, as the compiler optimizations are not always directly clear, when moving from an interpreted language like Python. Sometimes, it is hard to easily grasp why code is slow in Julia. However, once you understand a little how the language works, through reading and your own experiments, you begin to appreciate the language features and choices that have been made. Then, writing fast code is easier than ever. Of course, you don't have to do this alone. The Julia documentation is extremely rich with examples and detailed explanations of sometimes abstract and hard to understand concepts. Furthermore, many scientists have taken it on to develop general packages that make working in Julia more pleasant, or add the functionality that you are used to in other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this introduction, we will begin with some basic Julia features and explain different types. It is assumed that you have a working installation of Julia and that you have some experience with programming in general. We will illustrate Julia extensively by comparing this to Python, Matlab, and R, so some basic knowledge of at least one of these languages may be helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Julia Jargon\n",
    "Some words you might encounter frequently in any Julia tutorial are listed here with a short explanation. The Julia command-line is the basis for most applications, and is named REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop). The package manager is called Pkg, which takes care of all of the dependencies and environments of your Julia code, to make sure everything keeps running smoothly, when using external code. The word dispatch is also frequently used, and refers to the specific implementation of a method for (a set of) input objects. You can, for example, dispatch a function on several different types, which means that you create several implementations of a function on these different types."

The variable naming system is very flexible, and nearly all unicode (UTF-8) characters are allowed. For the Greek notation enthousiasts: you can use Greek letters in variable names, alongside some diacritic signs, such as hats; and sub- and superscripts.

These are so-called aliases for the `Array{T, 1}` and `Array{T, 2}` types respectively, but they have been given special names because of their frequency of use.

    "The output of the cell above shows 'foo (generic function with 1 method)'. This means that we have defined a function named \"foo\", and that there is one method coupled to this. We should therefore first clear up the difference between functions and methods. A _function_ is a specified, sometimes very general, procedure, such as \"Invert the position of the elements\". A _method_ is the specific implementation of this procedure, such as, if the input is a vector, the first element becomes the last, and so on. However, if the input is a multidimensional array, just saying \"invert the positions of the elements\" is too vague, and we need a different implementation that requires an additional argument, which specifies along which dimension we should invert the positions. The function is in this case the same, but the method is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, methods have a very important role in Julia. They have a similar role to class methods in object oriented programming languages. However, Julia is not object-oriented. Instead, it provides more freedom, as in an object-oriented language, a method is coupled to an object, defining the implementation of a function where the *first argument* is that object. In Julia, we can define methods for functions not only based on the first argument of a function call, but on the number of arguments and the types of any argument of a function. This is generally useful for mathematical operations, such as addition, where we cannot clearly distinguish one of the inputs that the function \"belongs to\". (In a + b, the + can belong to either a or b). In object-oriented languages, this is often difficult to solve, and leads to rules that define to which object a method belongs. In Julia, this is solved elegantly by removing the attachment of a method to an object, and making them stand by themselves.\n",

    "Mathematical operations like addition, multiplication and so on are also functions, each with their methods. It might become evident that functions play a central role in Julia. Take for example, the addition operation. When we ask Julia to show the contents of this function, we see that it has many different methods. This is because of the many different combinations of types that can be specified to the function in general. A separate definition is given for adding two `Float64`s and adding a `Float64` to an `Int64`. This is the case for all operations. The Julia programming style is to favour separate dispatches over internal conversion, as from dispatching functions on various arguments, the types of the inputs and the corresponding output are often known at compile-time, and easily inferred, enabling the compiler to selectively compile and optimize the actually called variations of functions.

It also describes the different packages that can be loaded directly in Julia code in the environment. The project file also contains project metadata when developing packages, such as the authors and the package version. The manifest file is an automatically generated file that contains the *specific* environment state for the user. In general, you only share the `Project.toml` file when sharing code, while the manifest file is specific for the user.

    "To activate or create a new environment, you can navigate to your desired project folder, start up a Julia REPL in there (or use the cd() `Julia` command to navigate) and start Pkg by pressing `]`. You can then use the command `activate .` (with the dot to specify the current folder) to activate or create a new environment. To reactivate the global environment you can use `activate` without any other arguments.\n",

In the current project-file, you can see that no package is loaded. However, we can already import some packages that are not imported by default, but are included in the Julia standard library.
